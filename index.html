        <h1>Our story</h1>
        <p>Discord is about giving people the power to create space to find belonging in their lives. We want to make it
            easier for you to talk regularly
            with the people you care about. We want you to build genuine relationships with your friends and communities
            close to home or around the
            world. Original, reliable, playful, and relatable. These are the values that connect our users and our
            employees at Discord.</p>

            <h1>Prologue</h1>
            <p>Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends
                around the world while playing games online. Since childhood, founders Jason
                Citron and Stan Vishnevskiy both shared a love of video games, cherishing the
                friendships and connections that formed while playing them. At the time, all
                the tools built for this job were slow, unreliable, and complex. Jason and Stan
                knew they could make a better service that encouraged talking, helped form
                memories, and recreated the feeling of togetherness all found through
                gaming.</p>

        <div class="text">
            <h1>Chapter One</h1>
            <p>So, in 2015, Stan and Jason started to bring Discord to life. People from all over
                the world loved it. Discord made it easy to genuinely communicate with friends,
                going beyond casual talking. Friends were staying in touch with their various
                communities. Discord was making it easy to participate in conversation, hopping
                around text, voice and video to talk. The technology was complex but the goal
                was simple: make Discord an inviting and comfortable home to jump into with
                your communities and friends. Within a few years, Discord began to take off, and
                devoted people who loved our product sprung up around the world.</p>
